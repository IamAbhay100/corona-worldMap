# corona-worldMap
This is the website that shows the Covid-19 cases on world map. As we know codiv-19 is stopped so i use old data of covid cases but we can use API instead of static data. This website uses MapBox API to show the world map . 

HOW TO USE THIS .
Step-1 : Download the all Files form https://github.com/IamAbhay100/corona-worldMap .
Step-2 : Open with any Source-code editor in my case I prefer VScode .
Step-3 : Download Live-server from the Extensions .
Step-4 : Right click with mouse and click on Open with live Server .

Note: Do not open html file directly it will show only world map.
